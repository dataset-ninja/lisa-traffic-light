There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test* (22481 images) and *train* (20535 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 times of day: ***day*** (24988 images) and ***night*** (18028 images). Additionally, every image marked with its ***sequence*** and ***track frame number*** tags. The dataset was released in 2016 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">BEUMER Group, Denmark</span>, <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Aalborg University, Denmark</span>, and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">University of California, USA</span>.
